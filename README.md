Tech enthusiast with experience to develop cloud solutions and front web development. I have a great appreciation of DevOps and DevSecOps as a discipline to ensure a company develop to its greatest potential and meet customers needs in time. "As the DevOps Handbook explain in the first paragraphy that to implement DevOps means to work together, to work towards a common goal, to enable the fast flow of planned work into production and ensure achievement of world class stability,availability,reliability and security." I truly believe in such a workflow to ensure faster, stable deployments for our company.


I am currently working on:
Creating infrastructure as a code using terraform to AWS where i want to implement a IoT device on matatus to congest the Nairobi city. I would wish to collabarate with anyone to ensure we implement as soon as possible.
I am also enhancing my skills in front end development and mobile app development using react and react native. Currently in advanced stages.
I am also working on certifications in AWS Developer Associate and Azure Administrator.

Fun Facts about me!!!
Passionate about Information Technology.
I am very social and love in constructive engagements with people.
I drink coffee more than 3 times a day.
